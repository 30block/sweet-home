        This prevents errors during home manager setup to cause the entry script
        to fail. It also moves ~/.zshenv to /etc/zshenv to avoid conflicts with
        newer zsh installs.

    - subject: Fix versioning
      hash: 7b9c94a7ffacd28a0b05df31e8e48427339a17fb
      body: >
        This fix allows the SWEET_HOME_VERSION env var to be available both in
        interactive

        ash shell and with zsh through .zshenv. It also fixes a bug where the

        published block version would be one version behind the latest due to

        the docker-compose pointing to the docker image instead of the local

        code.
